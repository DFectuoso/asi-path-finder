ASIPathFinder is a cooperative path finder that may be most useful for Real-Time Strategy Games.

Portions are based on the Path Finder I wrote for Space Harvest (http://spaceharvest.com).

There are no docs yet. I hope to provide full documentation, cleanup the example code, fix bugs, and hopefully provide a more real-world example project soon.

ASIPathFinder is a variation on techniques described by David Silver in this paper:

ASISearchNodeList is based on the binary heap algorithm as explained by Patrick Lester here:
